Ping/Traffic grapher by A'rpi
=============================

Dependencies:
libpng-dev, python3, gcc

Build/Install:
# make
# mkdir -p /var/arp4/traff/
# cp *.sh ping.list pingstat3 traffmon2 /var/arp4/traff/
# cp *.py pingdata pinger traffdata traffer2 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
# a2enmod cgi
# systemctl restart apache2

Running the data collectors:
============================
- ping.sh: runs pingstat3, writes data to: /var/pinger/
(ping.sh will ping IP addresses listed in text file /var/arp4/traff/ping.list)
- traff.sh: runs traffmon2, writes data to: /var/traffmon/
(traff.sh will monitor RX/TX traffic of all local ethernet interfaces)

Using the new Web-UI:
=====================
Graph UI:  http://IPADDRESS/cgi-bin/graph.py
- generating JSON data on the server (by cgi-bin/pingdata & traffdata)
- client side renders it all using heavy javascript (canvas draw)
  (css&js is embedded into graph.py file - a bit ugly but simplifies things)
- recommended for modern web browsers (chrome/firefox)
- optional URL parameters: ip (address list), dev (interface list), zoom, time:
  graph.py?ip=8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1&dev=eth2,eth3,bond1&zoom=500&time=1688505503

Using the old Web-UI:
=====================
Pinger UI:  http://IPADDRESS/cgi-bin/ping.py
Traffic UI: http://IPADDRESS/cgi-bin/traff.py
- generating PNG files on the server (by cgi-bin/pinger & traffer2)
- client side works without JS, very simple html only page
- recommended for mobile or smart-tv
